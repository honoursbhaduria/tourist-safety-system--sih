Problem Statement

This problem statement proposes the development of a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System that leverages AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing technologies. The system should include:

Digital Tourist ID Generation Platform
• A secure blockchain-based system that issues digital IDs to tourists at entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts).
• These IDs should include basic KYC (Aadhaar/passport), trip itinerary, and emergency contacts, and be valid only for the duration of the visit.

Mobile Application for Tourists
• Auto-assign a Tourist Safety Score based on travel patterns and area sensitivity.
• Geo-fencing alerts when tourists enter high-risk or restricted zones.
• Panic Button with live location sharing to nearest police unit and emergency contacts.
• Optional real-time tracking feature (opt-in) for families and law enforcement.

AI-Based Anomaly Detection
• Detect sudden location drop-offs, prolonged inactivity, or deviation from planned routes.
• Flag missing, silent, or distress behaviour for investigations.

Tourism Department & Police Dashboard
• Real-time visualizations of tourist clusters and heat maps of high-risk zones.
• Access to digital ID records, alert history, and last known locations.
• Automated E-FIR generation for missing person cases.

IoT Integration (Optional)
• Smart bands or tags for tourists in high-risk areas (e.g., caves, forests).
• Continuous health/location signals and manual SOS feature.

Multilingual Support
• App and platform available in 10+ Indian languages and English.
• Voice/text emergency access for elderly or disabled travellers.

Data Privacy & Security
• End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws.
• Blockchain ensures tamper-proof identity and travel records.

Background

In regions like the Northeast, where tourism is a key economic driver, ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount. Traditional policing and manual tracking methods are insufficient in remote and high-risk areas. There is a pressing need for a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, rapid response, and secure identity verification for tourists, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

Expected Solution

A robust digital ecosystem comprising:

• Web portal and mobile app for tourists and authorities.
• AI/ML models for behaviour tracking and predictive alerts.
• Blockchain-based ID generation and verification.
• Real-time dashboards for police/tourism departments.
• Optional IoT wearable integration for enhanced safety.
• Automated alert dispatch and evidence logging systems.
